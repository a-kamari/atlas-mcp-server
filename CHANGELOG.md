## [2.8.2] - 2025-05-19

### Changed

- Updated various dependencies including `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `commander`, `openai`, and `zod`.
- Standardized `RequestContext` usage across the MCP server (`server.ts`) and transport layers (`authMiddleware.ts`, `httpTransport.ts`, `stdioTransport.ts`) for improved logging and request tracing.
- Aligned `req.auth` in `authMiddleware.ts` with the SDK's `AuthInfo` type and enhanced JWT claim extraction for `clientId` and `scopes`.
- Alphabetized tool registration imports in `src/mcp/server.ts` for better organization.

## [2.8.0] - 2025-05-11

- **Repository Alignment**: Updated project structure, dependencies, and development scripts to align with the latest version of the `mcp-ts-template` (https://github.com/cyanheads/mcp-ts-template), ensuring consistency with best practices and template enhancements.

### Added

- **HTTP Transport Support**: Implemented an alternative HTTP transport layer for the MCP server, allowing connections over HTTP in addition to the existing stdio transport. This includes basic authentication middleware.
- **Enhanced Configuration System**: Integrated Zod for environment variable validation, providing type safety and clear error reporting for server configuration. Extended configuration options for server identity, logging, transport, HTTP settings, authentication, and rate limiting.
- **New Utility Modules**: Introduced new utility modules for:
  - `metrics`: Includes a `tokenCounter`.
  - `parsing`: Includes `dateParser` and `jsonParser`.
  - `security`: Includes `rateLimiter` and `sanitization` utilities.
- **Request Context Service**: Added a service for creating and managing request contexts, improving traceability and logging across operations.
- **Dependency Updates**:
  - Added `chrono-node` for advanced date parsing.
  - Added `openai`, `partial-json`, `sanitize-html`, `tiktoken` to support future AI and text processing capabilities.
  - Added `validator` for input validation.
- **New Dependencies & Scripts**: Added `ignore`, `winston-daily-rotate-file`, `yargs` as core dependencies, and `axios`, `js-yaml`, `typedoc` as development dependencies. Introduced new npm scripts for enhanced development workflows, including `docs:generate`, `fetch-spec`, `inspector`, `start:http`, and `start:stdio`.
- **OpenAPI Spec Fetching**: Added a new script `scripts/fetch-openapi-spec.ts` to retrieve OpenAPI specifications, likely for documentation or client generation.
- **Raw JSON for Unified Search**: The `atlas_unified_search` tool can now return raw JSON responses when specified, offering more flexibility for programmatic consumption.
- **Development Tooling**: Added `smithery.yaml`

### Changed

- **README Updates**: Improved clarity, accuracy, and formatting of the README.md. Updated tool descriptions, Neo4j setup instructions, and environment variable explanations.
- **Scripts & Configuration**:
  - Updated `db:backup` and `db:import` scripts in `package.json` to use `node --loader ts-node/esm`.
  - Standardized logger imports in database scripts to use barrel files.
  - Enhanced error logging in `db-import.ts`.
  - Changed default `BACKUP_FILE_DIR` in `src/config/index.ts` to `./atlas-backups` and corrected `fs` import order.
  - Updated `repomix.config.json` to ignore `.clinerules` and ensure a trailing newline.
- **Project Version**: Bumped version from 2.7.3 to 2.8.0.
- **Dependency Updates**:
  - Updated `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to `^1.11.1`.
  - Updated `@types/node` to `^22.15.17`.
  - Updated `node-cron` to `^4.0.3`.
- **Server Core Refactor**: Significantly refactored the main server startup (`src/index.ts`) and MCP server logic (`src/mcp/server.ts`) for better modularity, improved error handling, and to support multiple transport types.
- **Utilities Refactor**: Reorganized the `src/utils` directory into a more modular structure with subdirectories for `internal`, `metrics`, `parsing`, and `security`. Legacy top-level utility files were removed or relocated.
- **Internal Import Paths**: Updated internal import paths for logger, `ErrorHandler`, `McpError`, and `BaseErrorCode` across multiple service and utility files to align with the refactored `src/utils` structure and `src/types/errors.ts`.
- **Error Handling**: Adjusted error code mappings in `errorHandler.ts` (e.g., `PERMISSION_DENIED` from `FORBIDDEN`, `INTERNAL_ERROR` from `UNKNOWN_ERROR`) and updated specific error codes used in `dateParser.ts` (e.g. `VALIDATION_ERROR` from `PARSING_ERROR`).
- **Tool Response Creation**: Standardized MCP tool response creation by replacing custom `createFormattedResponse` utilities and `ResponseFormatter` interfaces with a local interface and the centralized `createToolResponse` function from `types/mcp.js`. This enhances consistency in how tools format and return their results.
- **Type Definitions**: Refactored `ToolContext` in `src/types/tool.ts` to be an alias for `OperationContext` and updated tool registration logic to reflect changes in middleware and permission handling.
- **Configuration Loading**: Improved project root detection and backup directory handling with enhanced security checks.
- **Developer Guidelines**: Significantly updated the developer cheat sheet (`.clinerules`) with comprehensive guidelines on request context, logging, error handling, sanitization, and an expanded repository structure overview.
- **`atlas_deep_research` Tool**: (Moved from Unreleased) Introduced a new MCP tool (`atlas_deep_research`) designed to initiate and structure deep research processes within the Atlas knowledge base. This tool allows users to define a primary research topic, goal, and scope, and break it down into manageable sub-topics with initial search queries. It creates a hierarchical knowledge graph in Neo4j, consisting of a root 'research-plan' node and child 'research-subtopic' nodes, facilitating organized research efforts. The tool supports client-provided IDs, domain categorization, initial tagging, and flexible response formatting (formatted string or raw JSON). Core logic resides in `src/mcp/tools/atlas_deep_research/deepResearch.ts`, with input validation using Zod schemas in `types.ts` and response formatting handled in `responseFormat.ts`. An example demonstrating its usage and output can be found in the [`examples/deep-research-example/`](./examples/deep-research-example/) directory.
- **Package Metadata**: Updated `package.json` with `files` directive, repository details (`repository`, `bugs`, `homepage`), an updated project description, and expanded keywords for better discoverability.
- **Knowledge Service Response**: The `KnowledgeService.addKnowledge` method now includes the `domain` name and `citations` in its response, providing more comprehensive data.
- **Task Service Response**: The `TaskService.createTask` method now includes `assignedToUserId` in its response, directly providing the assignee's identifier.

### Fixed

- **Documentation**: Updated the `docs/tree.md` to reflect the latest directory structure timestamp and changes from recent refactoring.
- **Task Creation Response**: Corrected the `atlas_task_create` tool to ensure the `assignedTo` field in the JSON response accurately reflects the `assignedToUserId` from the service layer, aligning output with input schema expectations.
